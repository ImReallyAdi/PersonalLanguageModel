# Frequently Asked Questions

## ü§î General Questions

### What is this project?
This is a Personal Language Model that runs entirely in your web browser. You can train it on your own text data and have conversations with it, all without sending any data to external servers.

### Do I need to install anything?
No! Everything runs in your web browser. Just visit the webpage and start using it.

### Is my data private?
Yes, completely! All processing happens in your browser. Your text and conversations never leave your device.

### What browsers are supported?
Any modern browser that supports WebAssembly:
- Chrome 57+
- Firefox 52+
- Safari 11+
- Edge 16+

## üöÄ Getting Started

### How do I deploy this to GitHub Pages?
1. Fork the repository
2. Go to Settings > Pages
3. Select "main" branch as source
4. Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment

### Why is the first load so slow?
The first visit downloads AI libraries (PyTorch, etc.) which are large. Subsequent visits are much faster as everything is cached.

### Can I use this offline?
After the first visit, most functionality works offline. However, the initial library download requires internet.

## üéì Training

### How much text do I need for training?
- Minimum: 200 characters
- Recommended: 1000+ characters
- Better results: 5000+ characters

### What kind of text works best?
- Consistent writing style
- Complete sentences
- Relevant to your use case
- Examples of the type of content you want the AI to generate

### How long does training take?
- Small model: 30 seconds - 2 minutes
- Medium model: 1-5 minutes
- Large model: 3-10 minutes

### Can I train multiple models?
Currently, only one model can be active at a time. Training a new model replaces the previous one.

## üí¨ Chat

### Why are the responses sometimes weird?
- The model is small and runs in a browser
- It needs more training data
- Try adjusting the creativity/temperature setting
- Character-level models can be quirky

### How can I improve response quality?
- Train with more and better text data
- Use a larger model size
- Adjust the temperature setting
- Provide more context in your messages

### Can I save conversations?
Currently, conversations are not automatically saved. You can copy/paste important parts manually.

## üîß Technical

### What AI model does this use?
A character-level Transformer model implemented in PyTorch, running via Pyodide (Python in WebAssembly).

### How much memory does it use?
- Small model: ~100MB RAM
- Medium model: ~300MB RAM
- Large model: ~800MB RAM

### Can I modify the code?
Yes! The code is open source. You can customize the UI, model architecture, or add new features.

### Does this work on mobile?
Yes, but performance may be slower on older devices. Newer phones and tablets work well.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### The page won't load
- Check your internet connection
- Try refreshing the page
- Clear browser cache
- Try a different browser

### Training fails
- Ensure you have enough text (200+ characters)
- Check that your browser has enough memory
- Try a smaller model size
- Refresh the page and try again

### AI responses are empty or broken
- The model may not be fully trained
- Try training with more text
- Refresh the page to restart
- Check browser console for errors

### Performance is slow
- Close other browser tabs
- Try a smaller model size
- Ensure your device has enough RAM
- Use a desktop/laptop for better performance

## üîÑ Updates

### How do I get updates?
If you forked the repository:
1. Go to your fork on GitHub
2. Click "Sync fork" button
3. GitHub Pages will automatically redeploy

### Will updates break my customizations?
Updates might overwrite your changes. Consider:
- Making changes in a separate branch
- Documenting your customizations
- Using git to merge updates carefully

## ü§ù Contributing

### How can I contribute?
- Report bugs by opening GitHub issues
- Suggest features in discussions
- Submit pull requests with improvements
- Share your experience and use cases

### I found a bug, what should I include in the report?
- Browser and version
- Steps to reproduce
- Error messages from browser console
- Screenshots if relevant

### Can I add new features?
Yes! Some ideas:
- Better UI/UX
- Model improvements
- Export/import functionality
- More training options

## üìö Learning

### I want to understand how this works
Great resources:
- [Transformer architecture paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)
- [PyTorch tutorials](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/)
- [Pyodide documentation](https://pyodide.org/)

### Can I use this for learning AI?
Absolutely! This is a great educational tool for:
- Understanding language models
- Experimenting with training
- Learning about transformers
- Seeing AI in action

## üéØ Use Cases

### What can I use this for?
- Personal writing assistant
- Creative writing inspiration
- Learning about AI
- Prototyping AI applications
- Educational demonstrations

### Can I use this commercially?
Check the MIT license, but generally yes for most uses. However, consider the limitations of a browser-based model for production use.

### Is this suitable for production applications?
This is primarily educational/experimental. For production:
- Consider server-based models
- Use larger, more sophisticated architectures
- Implement proper error handling and monitoring

## üîÆ Future

### What features are planned?
- Model saving/loading
- Better training data management
- Improved UI/UX
- More model architectures
- Export capabilities

### Will there be a mobile app?
Possibly! The web version works on mobile, but a native app could offer better performance.

### Can I request features?
Yes! Open a GitHub issue or start a discussion with your ideas.
